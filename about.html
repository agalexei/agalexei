                <div class="wow fadeInDown" data-wow-duration="0.5s" data-wow-delay="1.2s"><p>Hi there and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Ara Giulambarian and <span class="highlight4">I am a UX/UI Designer</span> based in Sydney.</p></div>
                <p class="wow fadeInDown" data-wow-duration="0.5s" data-wow-delay="1.2s">I began my career in financial sector after finishing my bachelor’s degree in Global Business and Business Strategy. I had always dreamed of working for a large, international firm, however I have found my love for entrepreneurship and small businesses. I quickly realised the corporate world is less glamour and more long, stressful hours and my love for creativity re-blossomed. One of my greatest passions is photography. I am a self-taught photographer, who through the development of my skills (as well as my career path) eventually wound up in the UX and UI industry.</p>
                <p class="wow fadeInDown" data-wow-duration="0.5s" data-wow-delay="1.4s">My experience in both financial services and luxury retail have allowed me to be on the front line, driving business results, which is where I thrive. Refining my sales strategy and skills, in my previous roles I have been able to quickly able to propel and earn the confidence of the executives to exceed performance expectations.</p>
                <p class="wow fadeInDown" data-wow-duration="0.5s" data-wow-delay="1.4s">Whilst I loved the retail and sales process and being able to generate revenue for the business, I realised I needed to combine my creative skills with my fascination for business and strategy. My new focus on what I want to do in life lead me to UX/UI design, and all the incredible ways it can help me generate change in the world. </p>
                <p class="wow fadeInDown" data-wow-duration="0.5s" data-wow-delay="1.6s">Having a multilingual and multicultural upbringing, I am able to see problems through multiple perspectives. My background will also allow me to meet your needs (as my client), cultural or otherwise. I'm focused on developing and testing designs that solve user’s needs, through elegant interfaces.
                </p>
                <p class="wow fadeInDown" data-wow-duration="0.5s" data-wow-delay="1.6s">I enjoy all aspects of the design process. My academic and market research background allows me critically perform user research, identify surprising and key user insights in the User Research process. My creative passions shine through in the User Interface elements and I also enjoy front-end development with my working knowledge in HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
                <p class="wow fadeInDown" data-wow-duration="0.5s" data-wow-delay="1.8s">As my career progresses, my goal is to move further towards a strategy role that drives the direction of the company in the products and overall service it provides. By approaching scenarios through different perspectives and an open mindset, I can easily solve your user’s problems through creativity and critical thinking.</p>
